# Analysis
After completing these subtasks, scroll up to the top to check off the main task.
- [ ] Read [article on analyzing usability tests](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/reporting-usability-test-results.html)
- [ ] Watch the [recording in Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Kih3WJvXYHTIw2RSnXCgzJDZnMonlS5T) and observe participant behavior, and [take notes here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kPUgCmxFp2X3cm33GvCbd41JzrfOYQye). Ideally the notes should be detailed enough to take you at least 1.5 times the length of the recording (i.e., a 30-min video will take at least 45 min to take notes on)
- [ ] Add [your insights in this Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l911DJDfDo0Yr70lagjSmx/Usability-test-analysis-FigJam)
- [ ] Below, summarize your recommendations for the design, future tests, the facilitating, etc.
