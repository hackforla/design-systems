# Plan

### 1. Required readings

- [ ] [About usability testing](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html)
- [ ] [Types of usability testing methods](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/running-usability-tests.html)
- [ ] [Writing a plan and types of metrics](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/planning-usability-testing.html)

### 2. Writing the sections of the plan

#### Constraints
- [ ] Scope (what is being tested)
- [ ] Purpose (why is this being tested, concerns, questions, goals for the test)
- [ ] Scenarios (what task the participant will be asked to complete)
- [ ] Method (think-aloud or probing)
- [ ] Metrics for success
- [ ] Discussion guide (questions asked before and after task)

#### Logistics 
- [ ] Sessions (length, buffer between sessions)
- [ ] Equipment (software) used to conduct and record test
- [ ] Participants (number, type, recruiting methods)
- [ ] Researcher roles (who does what)

### 3. Review

- [ ] Read through and discuss the plan with fellow researchers
- [ ] Pick one facilitator and at least one note-taker
- [ ] Paste the finalized research plan in Github comments and link the Google Doc draft
- [ ] Run a pilot at least a few days before a real session, and make notes how the pilot went in Github issues comments

# Facilitating 

### Moderator
- [ ] Rehearse script out loud
- [ ] Meet with note-taker 10 minutes before
- [ ] Send message to participant to double check availability
- [ ] Wait 15 minutes if participant is late
- [ ] Record the session
- [ ] Remain neutral – you are there to listen and watch. If the participant asks a question, reply with “What do you think?” or “I am interested in what you would do.” Do not jump in and help participants immediately and do not lead the participant. If the participant gives up and asks for help, you must decide whether to end the scenario, give a hint, or give more substantial help.
- [ ] Watch Slack for backchanneled questions from note-takers
- [ ] Update [recruiting spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wrx3dQXbti8kHvRdQFHuarW34DVnj0LNBs5nr3HDfBg/edit#gid=0) when session is done
- [ ] Upload recording to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1XmT-fMEY5L82acY3aQC98v7misBPmDXb), under the correct FF page that was tested

### Note-taker
- [ ] Review script questions
- [ ] Use note-taking template
- [ ] Meet with facilitator 10 minutes before
- [ ] Use Slack to backchannel questions you want the facilitator to ask
- [ ] Remain neutral – you are there to listen and watch. Do not jump in and help participants immediately and do not lead the participant.

# Analysis
- [ ] Read [article on analyzing usability tests](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/reporting-usability-test-results.html)
- [ ] Comment on this analysis issue who has been assigned to analyze the video
- [ ] Watch the recording and observe participant behavior
- [ ] If the plan laid out quant metrics, use a spreadsheet to calculate the metrics. If the plan laid out qual metrics, use Figma to record observations.
- [ ] List problems and classify them as critical (If we do not fix this, users will not be able to complete the scenario), serious (many users will be frustrated if we do not fix this; they may give up) or minor (users are annoyed, but this does not keep them from completing the scenario)
- [ ] Revisit analysis findings as more people participate in the usability test
