Issues should have these settings applied:
ASSIGNEE: who is doing the work 
LABEL: size = how long the work will take, role = what disclipine/team the work needs to be done by
PROJECT: which kanban board this will live in as a card. If it's not related to documentation protocol or onboarding, then it likely belongs in "Project Management."
MILESTONE: a project with an end goal. If your issue is part of a greater initiative to get something done, then it needs a milestone.

# Overview 
<!--Tell a story of your work's purpose and context. Mention relevant teammates with @. Make your summary detailed enough that someone unfamiliar to your work would be able to follow along. Put yourself in the shoes of a hiring manager in an interview, or a newbie to the team.

- Link other relevant issues in bullet points like this. 

You can list issues in checkboxes to create dependencies, but as of spring 2022 we recommend creating larger issues and using milestones instead.

# Action Items
<!--List tasks in chronological order. Link all relevant Google docs or external resources in context. For Google Drive documents, we strongly recommend linking files instead of folders, which can get moved or deleted.

As you complete the tasks, it is a good idea to come back and add your thought process, i.e., "Teammate x and I collaborated on this task in this Figma file. We decided that the most important takeaways from the participant 1 session was y. Based on y, we recommend design changes a, b, and c, because..."

If there are tasks that multiple assignees will be repeating, follow this format:

Make a comment with this template. Once you finish, come back to the main checklist above and check off your name.
