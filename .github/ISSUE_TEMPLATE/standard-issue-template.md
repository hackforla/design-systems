# Overview 
The point of an issue is to document your work for reference later. So TELL A STORY of your work's purpose and context. Make your summary detailed enough that someone unfamiliar to your work would be able to follow along. Put yourself in the shoes of a hiring manager in an interview, or a newbie to the team.

- Link other relevant issues in bullet points like this. (Past issues may have had issues in checkboxes to create dependencies, but as of spring 2022 our standard practice has changed. See the Github cleanup milestone.)
- Mention relevant teammates with @.

Issue settings

- ASSIGNEE: who is doing the work 
- LABEL: size = how long the work will take, what discipline/skillset is required. This issue will automatically have the ? question label applied. Remove it after you've notified the PM of your task.
- PROJECT: which kanban board this will live in as a card. If it's not related to documentation protocol or onboarding, then it likely belongs in "Project Management."
- MILESTONE: the greater context that this issue is part of.

# Action Items
List tasks in chronological order. Link all relevant Google docs or external resources in context. For Google Drive documents, we strongly recommend linking files, instead of folders that can get moved or deleted.

As you complete the tasks, it is a good idea to come back and add your thought process, i.e., "Teammate x and I collaborated on this task in this Figma file: http... We decided that the most important takeaways from the participant 1 session was y. Based on y, we recommend design changes a, b, and c, because... Update, we discussed a, b, and c in the all-hands meeting last week and our recommendations are set to be completed next month, and is being documented in issue #..."

If there are tasks that multiple assignees will be repeating, use this format instead of making a brand new issue:

### Assignees
- [ ] @ Team member
- [ ] @ Team member
- [ ] @ Team member

Make a comment with this template. Once you finish, come back to the main checklist above and check off your name.
