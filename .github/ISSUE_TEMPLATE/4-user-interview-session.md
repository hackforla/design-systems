# Documenting this issue

- [ ] Choose the labels `role: research` `size: 1 pt`
- [ ] Choose the milestone `User needs interviews`
- [ ] Choose the project `Project Management`

# Prepare to conduct or take notes
- [ ] Read the [interview guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VYCMj7JtDFvBtrs7hQKGdC0Jelkq07HYtwtlNWb-QSw) _thoroughly_
- [ ] Read the [Otter recording tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TLG1mmzImDCRcyLpktrTSHUb5nJB7xP4AsMNeE0PCG4)
- [ ] Document [interviewee data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KEf3kw9SRUqYAVtcDTTiWmg5TcMyeWb5MLU4oHETwVk)
- [ ] Confirm that a teammate with Zoom Pro will be available to record the session

# Analyze

To give each researcher the opportunity to practice affinity diagramming, analysis should be owned by researchers who weren't conducting the session.

- [ ] Schedule a meeting with your analysis partner to complete the affinity diagram through step 3
- [ ] Read the affinity diagramming directions at the top of [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/rbW89yoCha3ojI7kxaqvil/UXR-Interview-figjam?node-id=0%3A1).
- [ ] In the same Figma file, look for your participant's corresponding P number.
  - [ ] Replace `Participant` with their role `PM` `Designer` or `Developer`
  - [ ] Under step 1, type your name so the label says `[Your Name]'s Notes`
- [ ] Watch the interview
- [ ] Note your themes, ideas, and understandings under step 1
  - [ ] Avoid typing the participant's name or gender
  - [ ] Each sticky should be long and detailed enough to make sense out of context for newcomers or if the sticky gets dragged out of place
  - [ ] If you quote the participant, add the timestamp `[#:##]` and indicate truncation with `[...]`
- [ ] for step 2, funnel the insights into larger patterns that stick out to you. Label the smaller boxes with the name of the pattern.
- [ ] Review your work and fill out the template in step 3.
- [ ] @ the research lead and PM in the comments of this issue
