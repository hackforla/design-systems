#### Day of

- [ ] Watch the recording and observe participant behavior, and make your notes here
- [ ] List problems and classify them as critical (If we do not fix this, users will not be able to complete the scenario), serious (many users will be frustrated if we do not fix this; they may give up) or minor (users are annoyed, but this does not keep them from completing the scenario)
- [ ] Provide feedback on session protocol to next facilitator
- [ ] Revisit previous participant analyses as more people participate in the usability test
