# Plan

### 1. Readings

- [ ] [About usability testing](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html)
- [ ] [Types of usability testing methods](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/running-usability-tests.html)
- [ ] [Writing a plan and types of metrics](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/planning-usability-testing.html)

### 2. Writing the plan

- [ ] Make a copy of the [plan template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NA_fgcxF1QOAqKTZs6ZOeO_I2ugd-KZ5FvQx_9tF-oE/edit#) and move it into the folder for the section being tested
- [ ] Link the document in the comments of this issue

### 3. Review

- [ ] Pick one facilitator and at least one note-taker and @ them in the comments of this issue
- [ ] Read through and discuss the plan with them

# Facilitators and note-takers

### Session prep
- [ ] Run a pilot at least a few days before a real session, and comment below how the pilot went. Facilitator, reading the script out loud helps.
- [ ] Send message to participant to double check availability
- [ ] Be present in the meeting room 10 minutes before. Wait 15 minutes if participant is late
- [ ] Have Slack ready in the background. Note-takers, if you think of questions to ask the participant, send them in Slack to the facilitator.
- [ ] Note-takers, have your [note-taking template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MGU7DhhZmj7pkX9RIv5e8JUfnu78EWPU/edit#gid=676557520) ready.

### During the real thing
- [ ] Record the session
- [ ] Remain neutral ‚Äì you are there to listen and watch. Do not jump in and help participants immediately and do not lead the participant. Facilitators: If the participant asks a question, reply with ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am interested in what you would do.‚Äù If the participant gives up and asks for help, you must decide whether to end the scenario, give a hint, or give more substantial help.
- [ ] Update [recruiting spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wrx3dQXbti8kHvRdQFHuarW34DVnj0LNBs5nr3HDfBg/edit#gid=0) when session is done
- [ ] Upload recording to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1XmT-fMEY5L82acY3aQC98v7misBPmDXb), under the folder for the FF page that was tested

# Analysis
- [ ] Read [article on analyzing usability tests](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/reporting-usability-test-results.html)
- [ ] Comment on this analysis issue who has been assigned to analyze the video
- [ ] Watch the recording and observe participant behavior
- [ ] If the plan laid out quant metrics, use a spreadsheet to calculate the metrics. If the plan laid out qual metrics, use Figma to record observations.
- [ ] List problems and classify them as critical (If we do not fix this, users will not be able to complete the scenario), serious (many users will be frustrated if we do not fix this; they may give up) or minor (users are annoyed, but this does not keep them from completing the scenario)
- [ ] Revisit analysis findings as more people participate in the usability test
