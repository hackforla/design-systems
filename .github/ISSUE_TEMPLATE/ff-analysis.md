## Analysis Action Items

- [ ] Comment on this analysis issue who has been assigned to analyze the video
- [ ] Watch the recording and observe participant behavior
- [ ] If the plan laid out quant metrics, use a spreadsheet to calculate the metrics. If the plan laid out qual metrics, use Figma to record observations.
- [ ] List problems and classify them as critical (If we do not fix this, users will not be able to complete the scenario), serious (many users will be frustrated if we do not fix this; they may give up) or minor (users are annoyed, but this does not keep them from completing the scenario)
- [ ] Revisit analysis findings as more people participate in the usability test
