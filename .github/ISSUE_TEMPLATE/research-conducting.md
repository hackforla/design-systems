# Facilitating 

### Prep

  - [ ] Read the script out loud. 
  - [ ] Run a pilot with someone on the team pretending to be the participant.
- [ ] Decide who is going to record the call with Zoom Pro. If there is no Zoom Pro available, use Otter as a backup to transcribe the audio
- [ ] When done, comment below the [DS Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ACLGQ8FFW2MCUk9PVA) link of the recording file
  - [ ] Update [recruiting spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KEf3kw9SRUqYAVtcDTTiWmg5TcMyeWb5MLU4oHETwVk)

#### Day of
- [ ] Send a reminder to the participant via Slack direct message.
- [ ] Open Slack to your DMs with the note-taker, and keep it in the background. This is to receive any questions the note-taker might want you to ask (use your best judgment according to usability testing best practices as to whether the question is worth asking).
- [ ] Start the meeting room 10 minutes before. Wait 15 minutes if participant is late.

### During

- [ ] Remain neutral ‚Äì you are there to listen and watch. Do not jump in and help participants immediately and do not lead the participant. If the participant asks a question, reply with ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am interested in what you would do.‚Äù If the participant gives up and asks for help, you must decide whether to end the scenario, give a hint, or give more substantial help.
