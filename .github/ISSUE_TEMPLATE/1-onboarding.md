Until you have access, some of the following links will not work.
- [ ] Accept the Google Calendar invites to our recurring meetings. You do not have to go to meetings for a role that isn't yours (e.g., designers don't have to go to research team meetings).

(Bonus: adding your name pronunciation into your Zoom profile [in Zoom settings under "display name"](https://us05web.zoom.us/profile) is recommended.) Under **Status**, type in the days that you are generally free to work / be contacted, i.e. "Tuesday afternoons," "weekdays after 6pm," etc.
