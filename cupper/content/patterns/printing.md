**Cupper**'s output site includes a one-page {{% pattern "Print version" %}} of the generated library, available at `/print-version`. So, if your library base URL is `https://yourName.github.io/your-library`, you can print the whole library — to PDF if wanted — from the following address:

```
https://yourName.github.io/your-library/print-version
```

Print styles are also provided for individual pattern pages so, if you wanted to print off a single pattern document, you can!
