# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the **Cupper** pattern library builder. The basic rules are as follows.

* If you find a bug, a pull request is appreciated.
* If you don't know how to fix the bug, submit an issue with the "bug" label.
* Missing features are not bugs. If you think **Cupper** is missing an important feature, write an issue with the "feature" label. The more detail the better.
* It is not acceptable to personally attack or discriminate against other contributors. If you're a decent person, don't do it because you know it's not right. If you are a psychopath, don't do it because you are in a public forum where it might well damage your reputation.
